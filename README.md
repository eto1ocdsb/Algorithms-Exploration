### My current capabilities

#### At the time of writing, I am capable of solving the pyraminx. 

1. The ReadMe.md file: In this file you are required to write in Markdown your current skills abilities with regards to cubing. i.e. Type of cube, whether you can solve it yet or not, what method you use(name), your recorded ao5, ao12, ao25(along with dates and times accomplished)

2. Issues tab: In this tab you will create issues that come up, write possible solutions that you come up with to solve them, and close issues that have been solved.

3. Project Tab: Create one project with the basic kaban template(i.e. Tabs: todo, in progress, and done) where you will keep track of the tasks todo, in progress and done.
