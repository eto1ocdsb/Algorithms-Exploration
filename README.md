## _Pyraminx_

### My current capabilities
At the time of writing, I am skilled enough that I can solve the pyraminx. **However**, I only resort to a single tactic which sometimes does not work as planned.

### Method
The tactic I use involves completing one side with the correct edge pieces. Then I would find a colour whose front side is correct, but the edge is supposed to be on the other side of the pyraminx face. Then I would do other side edge and bottom edge down, then the incorrect edge and bottom down, then turn up the sides in the order you put them down. I would do that until I found two wrong pieces on the middle row, and one on the bottom, I would orient the pyraminx in a way that all wrong pieces are visible. Then, I would move the bottom piece in a way that it is on the middle row with the other wrong piece which has the **colours which is supposed to be where the originally bottom piece is**. Turn the pyraminx along the middle row from where you didnt put the bottom piece, then return the bottom piece back down, and rotate accordingly.

### Conclusion
Overall, my experience with a pyraminx can still be greatly improve as my method is not a "one size fits all" and the long solve times can be contributed to my narrow approach to the pyraminx.
